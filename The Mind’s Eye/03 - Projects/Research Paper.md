## Search Engine Optimization with MCP: 
Traditional SEO(on google search) tries to rank our websites based on how much it's finds it relevent to the query. It is no longer sufficient. We are looking for slightly different approach where our website should be linked to create the consolidated result given by LLM, and eventually increasing it's SEO.

1. Wll if we have MCP servers which are exposing API's, the chance of website, coming in the final result is quite high 





## Intro: 
The *Model Context Protocol* (MCP) allow the LLM to build the AI agents quickly at the same time we can let them access the resources such as DB, Google drive or and 3rd party API which is normally not accessible.
- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
