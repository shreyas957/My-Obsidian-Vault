# Cloud Computing
cloud is basically refers to delivery of various service.
Before we need to buys servers, setup was costly, high traffic handling, high maintenance, thus making expensive.
##### Why cloud? 
1. Huge amount of data.
2. Pay as you go --> Cost reduction
3. No limit on resources
4. safety from disasters

##### What is cloud then?
Cloud is pool of resources where we can rent it as per need and then we can only pay for what we use.
The security measures are provided by the cloud services providers.

##### What is cloud computing?
1. Storing data/applications on remote servers
2. Processing data/applications from servers
3. Accessing it via internet

#### Service Models
1. SaaS : We use software's which are owned and managed by somebody else. e.g. Gmail we just use as service.
2. PaaS : We don't control underlying infrastructure(OS, Storage, Server hardware), we get platform to build and deploy software's. e.g. Google App Engine, AWS Management Console.
3. IaaS : We manage computing resources over internet.


#### Deployment Models
1. Public : A service provider make resources available over internet. General public over internet can configure as per their need and use it. No wasted resources as we pay for what we use.
2. Private : Generally user create and manage it's resources. We need to manage hardware, and everything else. Can increase cost and limited resources. But provides better security for confidential data.
3. Hybrid : A cloud computing environment which mix of on premises (private) and public cloud services. Helps to leverage benefits of best of both worlds

#### Cloud Providers
They provides cloud services to people. They manage all the infrastructure and services and other people leverage it over the internet.
e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM cloud, etc.


#### Public VS Private
1. Cost : Private has heavy starting cost (due to hardware) and high maintenance cost. Cloud is cheaper and it is easy to predict the cost over time. But sometimes not used effectively can give more cost too.
2. Security : In private cloud owner manages the security. Whereas in cloud your data is in between pool of resources and managed by cloud provider. 
3. Control : We have more control in private, but it's time consuming and  need to setup. In cloud its easy to setup and implement.
4. Flexibility : Private cloud is more customizable and flexible, whereas public cloud is less customizable and more of stability and consistency.
