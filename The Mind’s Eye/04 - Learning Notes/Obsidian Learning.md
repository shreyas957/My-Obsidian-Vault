use tag(as a page ) --->add by [[]] --> to much use --> make it into index for better sorting

1. use < Ctrl + O > to create new note and then use < Ctrl + X > to insert a template 

- **00 - Indexes**: Placed at the top, as it acts as the central hub for navigation. This is ideal.
- **01 - Tags**: Positioned early for organizing metadata and searching by tags. Makes sense here.
- **02 - Templates**: Important for quick access when creating new notes. Its early placement is appropriate.
- **03 - Projects**: Active work deserves a high priority but comes after general-purpose folders like templates.
- **04 - Learning Notes**: These are secondary to active projects and resources but still critical.
- **05 - Resources**: Resources serve as references, so it's fine being after Learning Notes.
- **06 - Archives**: Naturally follows active folders as it's meant for older/completed work.
- **07 - Feeting Notes**: Temporary or fleeting notes are less critical, so placing them towards the end is fine.
- **99 - META**: Meta information rightly belongs at the bottom, as it's typically accessed the least.
